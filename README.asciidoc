The Thumpbot (a.k.a. Thumper, a.k.a. Thumpboy) is a somewhat-autonomous rolling robot that drives around and tries not to crash. Thumper is the de-facto platform for robot-tinkering of Harrington Hacknight Club. This repo contains programs for controlling Thumpbot in past, present, and future iterations.
